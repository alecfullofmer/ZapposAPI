ZapposAPI

Zappos Intern Challenge

<h2>Description</h2>
Program takes two inputs from the consumer: number of items they would like to buy and amount they would like to spend.<br>
It then, using the Zappos API, creates a list of ten combinations of products that are within their price range<br>

main() is located in the RunGiftItems class. Note that the program uses the json.simple library.

I had fun doing the challenge and really appreciate the opportunity. I definitely learned some new things.<br>
I didn't have much time to debug so I'm sure it isn't bulletproof. Program slows down exponentially as the consumers budget<br>
increases. Thanks for looking it over. I would love any feedback. <br>
